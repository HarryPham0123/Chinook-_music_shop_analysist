# Chinook_music_shop_analysist
In this project, I will be working with a database called Chinook. This database is associated with a digital music store. It contains the information about Employee, Customer, Invoice, Track, Playlist, Artist, Album,... The following questions will be explored:
- Top 10 gerne in USA and their tracks sold comming from Chinook shop?
- Total number of sales assigned to each Sales Support Agent within this shop?
- Determine which country, that customers belong to, profits the most for Chinook store?
- Answering whether or not the shop eliminates buying whole album options provided for customers?
- Top 10 most popular artists in Chinook?
